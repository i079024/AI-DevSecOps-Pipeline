- **Files After Filtering**: 4
- **Filtered Out**: 0 files (.class, .jar, build artifacts, etc.)

## Analysis Summary
This commit modifies 4 file(s), adding 0 and removing 0 lines. Critical system files were modified. 

## Security Fixes
- **Comprehensive Security Audit** [MEDIUM]: Perform complete security audit using SonarQube analysis

## Test Coverage Recommendations
- **CRITICAL**: Create test_mcp-http-wrapper.py with 6 test methods to achieve >90% coverage
  *Reasoning*: Source file mcp-http-wrapper.py modified - needs comprehensive unit testing to reach 90% coverage target

- **HIGH**: Create test_bot.py with 5 test methods to achieve >90% coverage
  *Reasoning*: Source file speculator_bot/bot.py modified - needs comprehensive unit testing to reach 90% coverage target

- **HIGH**: Create test_change_analyzer.py with 4 test methods to achieve >90% coverage
  *Reasoning*: Source file speculator_bot/core/change_analyzer.py modified - needs comprehensive unit testing to reach 90% coverage target

- **HIGH**: Create test_risk_analyzer.py with 4 test methods to achieve >90% coverage
  *Reasoning*: Source file speculator_bot/core/risk_analyzer.py modified - needs comprehensive unit testing to reach 90% coverage target

- **HIGH**: Create test_test_selector.py with 3 test methods to achieve >90% coverage
  *Reasoning*: Source file speculator_bot/core/test_selector.py modified - needs comprehensive unit testing to reach 90% coverage target

- **CRITICAL**: Create 18 additional test files to achieve 90% coverage
  *Reasoning*: Current coverage: 0.0%, gap: 90.0%

- **MEDIUM**: Add unit tests to cover all new code paths
  *Reasoning*: Current test coverage is below target threshold

## Gap Analysis
### Test Coverage Gap
**Concern**: Current coverage: 0.0% - Need 90.0% more to reach 90% target
**Recommendation**: Add unit tests for 4 modified files to achieve 90% coverage
