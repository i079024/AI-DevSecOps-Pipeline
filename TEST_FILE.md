# Test File for Git Analysis

This is a test file to create a meaningful commit for testing the Speculator Bot analysis.

## Changes Made
- Added this test file
- This should trigger the git analysis properly
- The Speculator Bot should now detect real changes

## Expected Behavior
When analyzing this commit, the Speculator Bot should:
1. Detect file changes (this file added)
2. Calculate lines added/removed
3. Provide real risk analysis instead of mock data

**Status**: Testing commit analysis
